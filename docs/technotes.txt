File Extensions and MIME Types
==============================

In order for SVG to be displayed correctly, the MIME type must be xhtml. Rendering
behavior may differ based on the browser, whether the files are being retrieved from the
local files system or a web server, the extension of the file, and whether the SCG is
inline or created dynamically. For the best shot at successfull rendering:

1. Use a .xhtml file extension.
2. Include the following <meta> element:
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8"/>
